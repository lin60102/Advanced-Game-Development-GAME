VR Arc Teleporter comes with everything you need to quickly get a locomotion system in your VR game.
To setup for SteamVR:
Drag the '[CameraRig]' prefab from the prefabs folder in SteamVR into the scene, on each controller object click 'Add Component' and search for 
'Arc Teleporter'.
To Setup for Oculus Native:
Create a new empty gameobject in the scene (optionally make sure it is on the floor), drag the 'OVRCameraRig' prefab as a child of the empty gameobject 
(optionally make sure 'Tracking Origin Type' is set to 'Floor Level' on the OVRManager component), drag the 'LocalAvatar' prefab as a child of the empty gameobject, 
on either both controllers or both hand objects click 'Add Component' and search for 'Arc Teleporter'.

Now allows for fading transitions, custom control schemes, a rotatable room and fire a projectile and teleport
to it as an alternative to the arc.

Make sure you do the same things with both controllers individually, unless you want them to act differently.

Oculus Native:
Switching between Oculus and SteamVR means using the alternative camera rig and switching the Virtual Reality SDK
found in Edit->Project Settings->Player.

VRInput:
When adding the Arc Teleporter script a VRInput will be added automatically. You can customize what you want the different
buttons to do. The arc teleporter will react to SHOW and TELEPORT although you can add your own script that reacts to different
names. VRInput will use the SendMessage method to call 'Input Received' with the action name as a parameter.

All information on the Arc Teleport component can be found by expanding the 'Help' foldout at the bottom of the component.
